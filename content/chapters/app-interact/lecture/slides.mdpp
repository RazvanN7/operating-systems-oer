# Application Interation

---

## Intro

* Applications: standalone or collaborative
* Examples:
    - trivial "hello world" application
    - application that reads data and writes data (text editor, compiler)
    - a text messenger application
    - the google search engine

* Are the first 2 examples scenarios of application interaction?
----

## Demo - Waze Application

* Image with how Waze interacts with other services

----
## Demo - Gdrive Application

* Image with Gdrive architecture

----
* This interaction is done between coupled or decoupled applications
* We distinguish between:
    - interaction of applications on the same system
    - interaction of applications on different systems
* Applications may communicate

----

## How do Apps Interact?

* An application that strives to communicate with other applications must offer an interface.
* The application may offer a user interface.
* TODO: image with user-app interface, app-app interface (on same system and on remote systems)

----

## OS - The Lawmaker

* The OS offers the primitives for app-app intercation
* The OS is like a lawmaker the dictates how the interaction takes place
* TODO: image with user-app, app-app interface on top of OS (same/remote system)

---

## App Classification

- Uni-process (single/multi threaded)
- Multi-process
- Examples
- These apps use OS primitives to communicate between them

---

## Interaction Models

- Inter-application
- Intra-application
- Communication channel
- Shared memory

----

## Communication channel

- TODO: img
- messages, packets
- sender receiver
- OS does the transmitting
- requires communication protocol
- used for inter-application interaction, but could be used for intr-app communication also

----

## Shared memory

- TODO: img
- apps have a common memory region they use to communicate
- OS sets up the memory
- requires synchronization
- used primarily by intra-app applications

---

## Operating System Interface for App Communication

----

## Communication channel

* send/receive interface
* notify/wait
